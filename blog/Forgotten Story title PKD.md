Many years back I read a short story, the details of which escape me.

I do however remember the last scene where our protagonist (a cop/investigator perhaps) tracks down his mark. After shooting him and expressing his disdain he looks down at his hand and notices that it is transparent, the wind the blows through his body, and we are left to assume that he was merely a figment of the marks imagination.

It's a great story and I'm desperate to read it again. Can you help with the title?
